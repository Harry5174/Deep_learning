      "NARRATIVETEXT: The ﬁrst of the two potent atmospheric river storms will develop and point at Northern California Wednesday before sweeping down the state and targeting Southern California Thursday.\n",
      "NARRATIVETEXT: The storm will start out very warm – fueled by moisture from near Hawaii that earns it the moniker of a pineapple express – and unload mainly rain in all but the absolute highest elevations in Northern California Wednesday. Central California should expect steady rain and gusty winds to begin late Wednesday and continue into Thursday.\n",
      "NARRATIVETEXT: Steady rainfall and periods of stronger winds will arrive in Southern California by Thursday morning. At the same time, much cooler air will begin to overspread the state.\n",
      "NARRATIVETEXT: More snow will accumulate and at lower elevations across parts of Northern California and the Sierra Nevada Thursday as cooler temperatures take over. Feet of snow could bury the highest peaks of the Sierras, with at least 6 inches of snow possible for some lower-elevation mountain roadways.\n",
      "NARRATIVETEXT: The snow is welcomed for California’s snowpack, which has been beleaguered by warmth and storms that have brought more rain than snow. This winter’s snowpack is just 52% of average for this time of year, according to the latest survey conducted by the state’s Department of Water Resources Tuesday. Snowpack is a vital water source, and the survey helps California to forecast how much water will be available for the rest of the year.\n",
      "NARRATIVETEXT: A few thunderstorms could rumble to life in the western half of California on Thursday and may produce bursts of heavier rain. A series of torrential thunderstorms fueled a proliﬁc rainfall event that plunged San Diego underwater last week.\n",

      "NARRATIVETEXT: The second storm looks to tap into even more robust moisture from an atmospheric river than the ﬁrst, with the potential to stall over the region and unload several inches of rain from Sunday to around midweek.\n",
      "NARRATIVETEXT: Temperatures are also likely to start out much cooler with this storm than with the ﬁrst storm, with more snow possible down to mountain pass levels or potentially even lower elevations.\n",
